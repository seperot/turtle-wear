TrtlWear is a watchface that tells you all the important things you need, like the time, date, weather,
battery, and how much TRTL is trading for.

## What is a TRTL?

TRTL is the short name for TurtleCoin, you can find more info and get involved [from their website](https://turtlecoin.lol/).

## The watch says 1 TRTL = 1 TRTL rather than a price
While this is always the correct answer, it could be that the app hasn't updated the watch yet (It refreshes in 5 min intervals)
or you could be having network problems. Give it a bit of time and check if you are connected to the internet.

## Why is **X** feature not added? Check [issues](https://github.com/seperot/TrtlWear/issues) and submit a suggestion if it's not there
